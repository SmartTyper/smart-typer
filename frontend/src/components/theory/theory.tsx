On a QWERTY keyboard, your fingers should be placed on the 'home row' â€“ that's the middle row of the keyboard, starting with the letters A to L. Each finger is responsible for reaching certain keys, reducing the distance they have to move and improving typing efficiency. Proper finger positioning, understanding of key mapping, and maintaining the correct posture during typing sessions are crucial for building speed and reducing fatigue. This doesn't only apply to the fingers, wrists and arms also need to be positioned correctly to avoid stress injuries."
